# Todo Application

This repository contains two versions of a simple To-Do List application: a Command Line Interface (CLI) version and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version. Both versions allow users to add, remove, and view tasks, with tasks stored in a file for persistence.

## Project Structure
- app.py: The CLI version of the To-Do List app.
- gui.py: The GUI version of the To-Do List app using Tkinter.

## Features
- Add tasks to a to-do list.
- Remove tasks from the to-do list.
- Tasks are saved to a file for persistence.
- CLI version provides text-based interaction.
- GUI version provides a user-friendly interface with buttons and a listbox.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Tkinter (for GUI version)

```
pip install tk
```

## Running the CLI Version
To run the CLI version of the To-Do List app, simply execute app.py:

```
python app.py
```
Once the app is running, follow the text prompts to add and remove tasks.

## Running the GUI Version
To run the GUI version of the To-Do List app, execute gui.py:

```
python gui.py
```
This will open a window where you can interact with the to-do list using buttons and a listbox.
